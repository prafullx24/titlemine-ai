Subject to the other provisions herein contained, this lease shall be for a term Five\n(5) years from this date (called \"primary term\") and as long thereafter as oil, gas or other\nmineral is produced from said land hereunder.\n3. The royalties to be paid by Lessee are: (a) on oil, one-eighth of that produced and\nsaved from said land, the same to be delivered at the wells or to the credit of Lessor into\nthe pipe line to which the wells may be connected; Lessee may from time to time purchase any\nroyalty oil in its possession, paying the market price therefor prevailing for the field where\n288\nproduced on the date of purchase; (b) on gas, including casinghead gas or other gaseous sub-\nstance, produced from said land and sold or used off the premises or in the manufacture of\ngasoline or other product therefrom, the market value at the well of one-eighth of the gas so\nsold or used, provided that on gas sold at the wells the royalty shall be one-eighth of the\namount realized from such sale%; and (c) on all other minerals mined and marketed, one-tenth\neither in kind or value at the well or mine, at Lessee's election, except that on sulphur the\nroyalty shall be One Dollar per long ton. Lessee shall have free use of oil, gas, coal, wood\nand water from said land, except water from Lessor's wells, for all operations hereunder, and\nthe royalty on oil, gas and coal shall be computed after deducting any so used. Lessor shall\nhave the privilege at his risk and expense of using gas from any gas well on said land for\nstoves and inside lights in the principal dwellings there on out of any surplus gas not needed\nfor operations hereunder.\n4. If operations for drilling are not commenced on said land on or before one year from\nthis date the lease shall then terminate as to both parties, unless on or before such anni-\nversary date Lessee shall pay or tender to Lessor or to the credit of Lessor in Bay City Bank\n& Trust Company Bank at Bay City, Texas (which bank and its successors are Lessor's agent and\nshall continue as the depository for all rentals payable hereunder regardless or changes in\nownership of said land or the rentals) the sum of Four Hundred & No/100 Dollars ($400.00)\n(hereunder called rental), which shal cover the privileges of deferring commencement or drill-\ning operations for a period of twelve (12) months. In like manner and upon like payment or\ntenders annually the commencement of drilling operations may be further deferred for suc-\ncessive periods of twelve (12) months each during the primary term. The payment or tender of\nrentals may be made by check or draft of Lessee mailed or delivered to said bank, or Lessor;\non or before date of payment. If such bank (or any successor bank) should fail, liquidate or\nbe succeeded by another bank, or for any reason fail or refuse to accept rental, Lessee shall\nnot be held in default for failure to make such payment or tender of rental until thirty (30)\ndays after Lessor shall deliver to Lessee a proper recordable instrument, naming another bank\nas agent to receive such payment or tenders. The down cash payment is consideration for this\nlease according to its terms and shall not be allocated as mere rental for a period. Lessee\nmay at any time execute and deliver to Lessor or to the depository above named or place of\nrecord a release or releases covering any portion or portions of the above described premises\nand thereby surrender this lease as to such portion or portions and be relieved of all obli-\ngations as to the acreage surrendered, and thereafter the rentals payable hereunder shall be\nreduced in the proportion that the acreage covered hereby is reduced by said release or re-\nleases. In this connection the above described premises shall be treated as comprising 200\nacres, whether there be more or less.\n5. If prior to discovery of oil or gas on said land Lessee should drill a dry hole or\nholes thereon, or if after discovery of oil or gas the production thereof should cease from\nany cause, this lease shall not terminate if Lessee commences additional drilling or re-work-\ning operations within sixty (60) days thereafter or (if it be within the primary term) com-\nmences or resumes the payment or tender of rentals on or before the rental paying date next\nensuing after the expiration of three months from date of completion of dry hole or cessation\nof production. If at the expiration of the primary term oil, gas or other mineral is not\nbeing produced on said land but Lessee is then engaged in drilling or re-working operations\nthereon, the leases shall remain in force so long as operations are prosecuted with no cessa-\ntion of more than thirty (30) consecutive days, and if they result in the production of oil,\ngas or other mineral so long thereafter as oil, gas or other mineral is produced from said land.\n289\nIn the event a well or wells producing oil or gas in paying quantities should be brought in\non adjacent land and within one hundred fifty (150) feet of and draining the leased premises,\nLessee agrees to drill such offset wells as a reasonably prudent operator would drill under\nthe same or similar circumstances.\n6. Lessee shall have the right at any time during or after the expiration of this lease\nto remove all property and fixtures placed by Lessee on said land, including the right to draw\nand remove all casing. When required by Lessor, Lessee will bury all pipe lines below ordi-\nnary plow depth, and no well shall be drilled within two hundred (200) feet of any residence\nor barn now on said land without Lessor's consent.\n7. The rights of either party hereunder may be assigned in whole or in part and the pro-\nvisions hereof shall extend to the heirs, successors and assigns, but no change or divisons\nin ownership of the lands, rentals, or royalties, however accomplished, shall operate to en-\nlarge the obligations or diminish the rights of Lessee. No sale or assignment by Lessor shall\nbe binding on Lessee until Lessee shall be furnished with a certified copy or recorded instru-\nment evidencing same. In event of assignment of this lease as to a segregated portion of\nsaid land, the rentals payable hereunder shall be apportionable as between the several lease-\nhold owners ratably according to the surface area of each, and default in rental payment by\none shall not affect the rights of other leasehold owners hereunder. If six or more parties\nbecome entitled to royalty hereunder, Lessee may withhold payment there of unless and until\nfurnished with a recordable instrument executed by all parties designating an agent to re-\nceive payment for all.\n8. The breach by Lessee of any obligations arising hereunder shall not work a forfeiture\nor termination of this lease nor cause a termination or reversion of the estate created here-\nby nor be grounds for cancellation hereof in whole or in part save as herein expressly pro-\nvided. If the obligations for reasonable development should require the drilling of a well\nor wells, Lessee shall have ninety (90) days after ultimate judicial ascertainment of the\nexistence of such obligation within which to begin the drilling of a well; and the only penal-\nty for failure to do so shall be the termination of this lease save as to ten (10) acres for\neach well being worked on and/or being drilled and/or producing oil or gas to be selected by\nLessee so that each 10-acre tract will embrace one such well.\n9. Less or hereby warrants and a grees to defend the title to said land and agrees that\nLessee at its option may discharge any tax, mortgage or other lien upon said land and in\nevent Lessee does so, it shall be subrogated to such lien with the right to enforce same and\napply rentals and royalties accruing hereunder toward satisfying s ame. Without impairment of\nLessee's rights under the warranty in event of failure of title, it is agreed that if Lessor\nowns an interest in said land less than the entire fee simple estate, then the royalties and\nrentals to be paid Lessor shall be reduced proportionately.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, this instrument is executed on the date first above written.\nTom J.
